APPROACH:
Dataset and Preprocessing:
•	This repository contains dataset for the expense prediction model and the .ipynb file that contains the code of the model
•	Initial dataset contains around 200 columns containing the monthly expenses for the respective reason.
•	The data is pre-processed by reducing the number of categories as following:
•	Clothing , Electronical appliances , Mobile electronics, Fashion accessories, Groceries, Miscellaneous, Processed foods, Stationary , Toiletries , Toys , Medicines , Hygiene products , Home appliances , Household essentials
•	The first processed data has a schema of :
•	Gender,Age,Type,Month,Year,Expense

Since this preprocessed_data1.xlsx file has only 350 records which is insufficient for analysis , we obtain the range of expenses for each category.
Using this range we extrapolate the dataset by random imputation of values within the respective ranges.

AI Model selection and expense Prediction:
Extensive experimentation was conducted with various machine learning algorithms to 
find the best predictive model. The dataset was tested with models like K-Nearest 
Neighbours (KNN), Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), 
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), with each model's accuracy in predicting expenses
carefully evaluated.

Linear Regression stood out as the most accurate model, delivering an impressive 
accuracy of 88.13%. It was implemented using Intel OneAPI’s Sklearnex package, known
for improving performance and scalability in machine learning tasks. After selecting 
the best model, it was prepared for deployment by pickling, ensuring it seamlessly
integrated with the platform's predictive features.


Deployment in Web-Interface
For deployment, a website serves as one of the best platforms,
making user interaction simple and accessible. NextGen Budgeting offers an 
intuitive and visually appealing dashboard designed to enhance user experience.

compared against total predicted expenses. The remainder is displayed as the potential
savings amount, giving users a transparent view of their financial situation.

Chatbot: The conversational chatbot helps users track their expenses in an engaging
manner. By entering their spending information, users can receive personalized 
financial tips and advice, keeping them motivated to save and stay on track with
